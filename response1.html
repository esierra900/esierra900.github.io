    <p> I think this article on coding was extremely interesting. For starters I am amazed at how this article was made and how responsive it is. I scrolled all the way down to see how long the article was and the software kept track of how fast I was reading. I found that amazing. This article really opened my eyes to what coding is. I initially thought everything was a one man act like the coder can do it all but man was I wrong. There are so many components to coding that its insane, you have people who take care of algorithms and then you have people creating software and there are people who do the html coding and CSS. I also found it interesting how there are so many languages when it comes to coding and how they operate differently. The article also explained how the images in my screen are being shown and it’s this idea of breaking things down, down this tree like system. For example I press a key, that sends out a code, and then the computer deciphers that code into shapes. It’s actually amazing but also sounds like a humongous headache.  I also found it interesting how he brings up the topic of gender in the code community. Not only am I learning the technical things about this but I’m also learning about the profession itself.</p>
